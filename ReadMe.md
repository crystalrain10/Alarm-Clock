Custom Lab Project - Alarm Clock

Objective

	The objective of the custom lab is to create a project with the techniques used in our previous labs so that we may learn to apply the learned techniques. In this case, our custom lab project was limited to three different given projects: Jukebox, Alarm Clock, and the game Simon. Below is my proposal for the lab project I decided to take on.

Proposal

My custom lab project will be the Alarm Clock design with the specifications given by the professor. The Alarm Clock design will include the following specifications:

		LCD to display time
		Button press to tell clock that user is setting time
		Button press to tell clock that user is setting alarm 
		Input of numbers to represent time
		Buzzer goes off for alarm
		Button for snooze, snooze capability
		Extra Credit: visual cue when alarm goes off for hearing impaired 
		
    
* Buttons are labeled in the lab report in a picture. 
    
Materials Used: AVR Studio 7 (Program), ATmega1284 microcontroller, 16x2 LCD, 5 LEDs
